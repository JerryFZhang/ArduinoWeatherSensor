#ArduinoWeatherSensor
This is the code and library for Arduino with 1602 LCD and DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor.

# How to use
Please refer to Arduino.cc website and setup the LCD display as shown on the picture.
Please refer to any DHT11 manual on the internet to set it up properly.

#Todo
- A detailed blog post as an instruction
- Optimization on the printing algorithm so that the screen updates only when the data has changed. This can minimize the power comsumption for updating the display on a secondly basis.
